VEGAN VERSIONS 

Version 1.2-1
=============

* Checked with R-1.4-0 (frozen snapshot) tools: Documentation and
  method consistency corrected (summary.decorana.R, decorana.Rd), and
  file permissions changed.

* decorana.Rd: removed dependence on package `multiv' in the example,
  since it is not a `recommended package' -- replaced with
  `decorana(..., ira=1)'.

Version 1.2-0
=============

Based on experimental version 1.1-6. Doesn't include read.cep() of the
experimental version, because the function is certainly unportable to
all platforms (works on Red Hat Linux 7.1, but perhaps nowhere else).

Major new feature:

* decorana(): R port of Mark Hill's DECORANA for Detrended
  correspondence analysis, with methods print(), summary() and plot().

Minor changes:

* postMDS(): finds isoMDS scores and doesn't destroy list structure.

* vectorfit: finds isoMDS scores and decorana row scores (which are
  uncentred, though).

* Proof reading in documentation.

Version 1.0-3
=============

* `plot.procrustes': selection of axes plotted, improved scaling in
  graphics, control of axis labels.

* `postMDS': added plot to demonstrate half-change scaling. 

* `procrustes': target can now have lower dimensionality than rotated matrix.

Version 1.0-2
=============

* Fixed bugs in documentation.

* `plot.procrustes': Fixed passing `...' to graphics functions.

Version 1.0-1
=============

* The first public version.
